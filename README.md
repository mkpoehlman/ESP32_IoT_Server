# ESP32_IoT_Server, Author Mark Poehlman
This project demonstartes the use of ESP32 Development Board, .96" Oled Display and NTC Thermistor to create an IOT Web Server.
The code was written with the Arduino IDE and provides an HTTP server with HTML page that has a submit form.
Data submitted via the web page is displayed on the attached OLED display and controls the onboard LED if it is a valid
command.  In addition, IP Address of the server,LED status and Temperature are displayed on the OLED.  
See Arduino Sketch and Diagram for more details.
